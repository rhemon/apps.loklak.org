# loklak Movie Tweets

This form uses the [loklak public API](http://loklak.org/) to search the last 100 most recent tweets about the specified films.  
Styles by [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).

## Use

Since it's plain HTML/JS, you only have to download both `index.html` and `script.js` and place them in the same directory.  
Every time you change the content of the text box with a new film name and press <kbd>ENTER</kbd>, the results should update automatically. However, if it doesn't work, you can use the *Search!* button at the right.

> Your browser must have JavaScript enabled, and Internet connection
